The Riddler solved by this program is [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-find-a-number-worth-its-weight-in-letters/).

To run:
>`make run`

Output (spoiler alert!):
```
best number under 10000: 279 with an alphanumeric value of 284
and a string of "two hundred seventy nine"
20+23+15+8+21+14+4+18+5+4+19+5+22+5+14+20+25+14+9+14+5=284
```
