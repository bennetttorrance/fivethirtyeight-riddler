# Contributing a Solution
Thanks for your interest in contributing a solution or improvement! There aren't many rules - see the instructions below to get your solution into the repo!

## Solution to a new problem or solution in a new language
- If this is a new problem, make a directory at the top level of the repo. If the problem has a name, use the exact name (without punctuation) in `UpperCamelCase`. If not, make a concise and descriptive name!
- Make a directory within the new top-level directory with the language and version, e.g. `go/1.12`
- Add your solution, make a PR!

## Improvement to an existing solution
- Write your improvements, make a PR!
